I am told that all of you know a decent amount of sql from college work, so use this assignment to refresh or pick up sql basics before you come to class.

 

Install latest version of mysql server (install workbench as well).
Install "mysqlclient" package to enable python connectivity to mysql (install a wheel if you run into issues...., figure out what that means).

Now do the following tasks from a python click script - not using mysql client or workbench, you can use them to verify what you did. Implement the following commands - take arguments as appropriate

 

createdb -> command that creates a database and the appropriate tables (students and marks) and foreign key relationship between marks and students tables
dropdb -> drop the database
importdata -> import the data in the students.xlsx in assignment 2 and marks.xlsx that you generated in assignment 3 into the tables.
collegestats -> print out a console report showing number of students per college and the min, max and average marks of students from the college. [college acronym, student count, min, avg, max]
 

If you can do these, then you have sufficient sql background for the summer class. If not, please search  some sql tutorials and understand these before you come.

 

NOTE:

If you are stuck for more than a day on installation, take help from each other on forums and do it.
