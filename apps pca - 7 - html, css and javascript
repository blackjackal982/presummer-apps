The apps course assumes that you have some basic knowledge of putting up a static html page, style it and add some basic javascript interaction to it.

 

For html and css, pick up any of the innumerable tutorials and do a few sample pages before you come.
For js, do this in addition to anything else you do on your own (just the free parts will do) : https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript
With this all the assignments have been posted. 

All the best!
