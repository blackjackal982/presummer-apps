Estimated time: 90-120 minutes 

 

If you do not finish the task in the estimated time, it is OK. The important thing is to finish this on your own as much as possible. Over time you will get faster with practice and reflection on what works well for you.

 

Use the guidelines in @21 to figure things out and get this done. Note that we will use all the packages given in assignments in summer, so do finish these assignments for sure.
